<div align="center">

  started coding in 2016, now working as a low key backend web engineer.
  
  been tinkering with low level stuff every now and then since 2020, dabbling in kernel development lately.

  when u dont see much activity of me, it's most likely because i'm playing Valorant or hanging out with my significant other.
