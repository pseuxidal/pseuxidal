  Started coding in 2016, now working as a low key backend web engineer.

  Having worked on my projects solo, I've assimilated myriad concepts yet relatively unaccompanied by a coding prowess.
  
  Been tinkering with low level programming every now and then since 2020.

  Dabbling in windows kernel driver development lately.
