<div align="center">

  been tinkering with windows low level stuff every now and then.

  when you see me inactive, that's most likely cuz im enjoying my life with my luv.

  love spending time on Zodiacon's book such as [Windows Kernel Programming, Second Edition](https://leanpub.com/windowskernelprogrammingsecondedition) and [Windows 10 System Programming](https://leanpub.com/b/windows10systemprogrammingP1and2)
